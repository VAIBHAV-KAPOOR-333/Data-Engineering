A Star Schema is a simple data model where:

There is ONE central table → Fact Table
Connected to multiple surrounding tables → Dimension Tables


Why Star Schema is Used in Snowflake?

Very easy to understand
Fast querying (important for BI tools like Power BI, Tableau)
Perfect for analytics & reporting
    

A Snowflake Schema is an extension of Star Schema, where:

Dimension tables are broken into smaller tables
More joins


| Feature         | Star Schema | Snowflake Schema |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Complexity      | Simple      | Complex          |
| Number of joins | Less        | More             |
| Performance     | Faster      | Slightly slower  |
| Storage         | More        | Less             |
| Snowflake Usage | Preferred   | Used when needed |


# In Snowflake, storage is cheap → Star schema is usually preferred.




Partitioning means dividing large data into smaller logical pieces so queries run faster.

Snowflake uses:
Micro-Partitions
Automatic
Invisible to user
Created while loading data
Usually 16MB–512MB in size


Snowflake:
Automatically scans only relevant micro-partitions
This is called partition pruning
✔ Faster queries
✔ Less cost

📌 You don’t worry about indexes much in Snowflake.
